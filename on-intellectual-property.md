# On Intellectual Property

The intended purpose of IP---such as copyright and patents---is to promote artistic and technological progress by giving the authors and inventors exclusive rights to their work. This is the most common defense and it seems sound and logical. Why not reward people for putting in the effort to create something new? Enough people agreed it was a good idea that today most of the world is a member of the **World Intellectual Property Organization**---**WIPO**---an international body that aims to implement and enforce a global IP system. But do people really need such an incentive to create? I think the thousands of years of recorded human history beg to differ.

We made it all the way to the 18th century without copyright. There are a great many works and technologies that were created long before they could be copyrighted or patented without any monopolistic incentive. People do not exercise creativity for the promise of pay they do so because they want to express themselves, being able to profit from the endeavor is secondary. Many a scientific discovery has been made and shared with the rest of humanity. In research fields it is still the case that discoveries made are to be published and made available for anyone to use. The Higgs boson wasn't found because the scientist working to discover it wanted exclusive rights to use it. They wanted to expand theirs and everyone's understanding of the universe. People are not so simplistic as to only do things when there is profit to be made.

IP has come to be the antithetical to its original intent. Instead of bolster and promote new ideas it hinders them greatly. If you are an inventor you can't just come up with an idea
