# AI Generated Text

<p id='article-date'>07/17/2022</p>

It's getting pretty hard to tell apart text written by humans and AI. In fact this blog post was written by AI. Can you tell?

Sure, there are a few errors here and there. But overall, the text looks pretty good. And it's getting harder and harder to spot the errors.

This is all thanks to the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a subset of AI that deals with understanding and generating human language.

And the results are pretty amazing. With the help of NLP, AI can now generate pretty convincing text.

The benefits of using AI to generate text are many. For one, it can save a lot of time. Have you ever spend hours staring at a blank screen, trying to come up with the perfect opening sentence for your blog post?

With AI, you can just feed it a topic and it will spit out a fully formed opening sentence (or paragraph, or even a whole blog post).

This can be a huge time saver, especially if you're a busy person.

Another benefit is that AI can help you come up with ideas that you would never have thought of on your own.

By feeding it a topic, you can get a whole different perspective on that topic. And this can help you come up with new and innovative ideas.

So if you're stuck for ideas, or if you just want to save some time, why not give AI a try? You might be surprised at the results.
